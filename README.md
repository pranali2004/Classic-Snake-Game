# Classic-Snake-Game
The Snake Game is an arcade game where you control a growing snake that moves continuously on the screen. The player directs the snake using keyboard inputs to collect food, which makes the snake longer. The challenge is to avoid crashing into the walls or the snakeâ€™s own tail.
