#Classic Snake Game in Java
The Snake Game is a popular arcade game where a snake moves around the screen, growing in length as it eats food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

Why Build Snake Game in Java?
As a beginner, this project helped me to learn:

Java Swing & AWT for creating a graphical user interface.
Game loop using Timer and ActionListener for smooth movement.
Handling user input with KeyListener to change the snake’s direction.
Basic logic & conditions to check for collisions and update the game state.

How It Works:
-The snake moves continuously in one direction.
-The player controls the direction using arrow keys.
-Eating food increases the snake’s length and score.
-The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
